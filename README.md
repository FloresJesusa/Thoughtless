## Description

Perhaps you are often in a situation where you want to jot down a thought that crosses your mind as quickly as you can so that 

1. You don't have to keep trying to remember it. 
2. You can move on to anticipate the next stream of thoughts. 

In those cases, Thoughtless, as its name implies, can help you store your thoughts quickly if you have a busy mind like I do.

#### Features:

- Immediate text entry mode every time you launch the app for a quick dump of thought.  
- Text formatting via Markdown. 
- Markdown's characters access on keyboard.  
- Search your thoughts. 
- Various swipe gestures for intuitive in-app navigation. 

ps: Make sure your device has iCloud pre-enabled.
